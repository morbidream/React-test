# I was required to do the following:
"Please write a simple React component that does the following:  
The component takes one prop named "input". 
There are three types of input:  
  1. If the prop is a falsy value, return a live-updating date and time (update every second) in a div. Please pretty-format the date and time. Use the native JavaScript Date object.  
  2. If the prop is an array, return a list of divs, each containing one element of the array.  
  3. If the prop is anything else, return the value of the prop in a div.  

A functional component using React Hooks is preferred, though not required.  In the text box below, please provide a link to your https://codesandbox.io/s project displaying instances of the component - one per input type."
